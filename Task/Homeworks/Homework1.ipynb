    "* b) In relation with the number of error in train set the best SVM is the SVC with polynomial kernal. Howover, taking acount the model generalization in a possible test train the best SVM is the SVC with linear kernel because the \"margin\" concept became the model more robust on dataset with non-linear separable classes.\n",
